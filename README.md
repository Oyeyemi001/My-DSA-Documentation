# My-DSA-Documentation

This is where I started my Portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with Digital Skill up Africa- the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from MS Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building

## Project Topic: E Commerce Sales Analysis
